Portfolio Website Development Session
Victor Cornbert IJnzonides Portfolio

---

USER INPUT #1:
Hello ! I would like to build my own portfolio website that I can host through GitHub, I think I need an html and a css file for that, but otherwise make the other neccesary files as well. I would like every line of code to have comments after them explaining what the code does. I want my homepage background to be black and to have a black square in the middle with a dark grey border. Inside the square at the top (but centered) I want my name "Victor Cornbert IJnzonides', below that I want three square boxes with a thin dark grey outline, in each box should be a link to the next page of the website. The first box will be called 'Academics', the second 'Art', and the third 'Me'. On each of those pages, I'd like the background to be black still and have multiple tabs to press on the left side. I want each tab to be a square block with rounded edges that hug the left side of the screen with no edge visible on that side. Inside each square block I can add text of what project or information is when you click that block. When you hover one square block, it is enlarged a bit (I would like to be able to play around with the enlargement) through an animation of becoming slightly bigger. When you click a block, I want the content of that page to become visible on the rest of the page (the black background that was there), so besides all the tabs with content titles. I would like all the text to be white and to use the font JetBrains Mono

KIRO OUTPUT #1:
I'll help you build a portfolio website that you can host on GitHub Pages. Let me create the necessary files with detailed comments explaining each line of code.

Created complete portfolio website with:
- index.html - Homepage with name and three navigation boxes
- academics.html, art.html, me.html - Section pages with tabbed content
- styles.css - Complete styling with JetBrains Mono font, black background, and hover animations
- script.js - Interactive functionality for tab switching
- README.md - Instructions for deployment and customization

Key Features Implemented:
- Black background throughout the site
- Central black square with dark grey border on homepage
- Three navigation boxes linking to section pages
- Left-side tabs with rounded edges that hug the screen
- Hover animations that enlarge elements
- Smooth transitions and fade-in effects
- White text using JetBrains Mono font
- Fully responsive design

USER INPUT #2:
Can you change the side tab animation so that the tab is not cutoff? I see each tab as a rectangle with rounded edges indeed, but when I hover over it the rounded edges disappear. I would like to see the fullly enlarged tab. Also make it 10% bigger enlarged please. Could you also add that when you click on one of the home page's three boxes and get to the next site, there is no text shown on it yet from any of the side tabs. The side tabs info only appears after having clicked on one of them. Could you within each side tab also include this link https://www.google.com/ and this image https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fk9wl9ypumyp31.png and this Youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJZmO5mByVY&list=RDoJZmO5mByVY&start_radio=1 with the Youtube video being playable inside the page?

KIRO OUTPUT #2:
Fixed tab animation cutoff issue, changed enlargement to 10%, and added embedded content.

Changes Made:
- Fixed CSS hover effects with transform-origin: left center to preserve rounded corners
- Updated HTML content to hide by default until tab is clicked
- Added Google links, Reddit images, and playable YouTube videos to every tab section
- Added proper responsive video containers and styling for embedded content
- Ensured all embedded content is properly contained and styled

USER INPUT #3:
Can you make it so that when I click on a tab, the tab stays enlarged and only goes back to normal size when I click on another tab?

KIRO OUTPUT #3:
Added persistent tab selection state with visual feedback.

Changes Made:
- Added 'active' class styling to keep selected tabs enlarged
- Updated JavaScript to manage active states between tabs
- Only one tab can be active at a time, switching automatically
- Active tabs remain enlarged until another tab is clicked

USER INPUT #4:
Can you create a 3-body problem animation for me? I want to see three objects orbiting each other in a realistic way based on gravitational forces.

KIRO OUTPUT #4:
I'll create a 3-body problem simulation with realistic gravitational physics.

Created 3-body problem animation with:
- Three masses with different colors and sizes
- Real gravitational force calculations using Newton's law
- Numerical integration for realistic orbital mechanics
- Interactive canvas animation
- Adjustable parameters for experimentation

The simulation shows chaotic orbital behavior typical of 3-body systems, with complex trajectories that demonstrate the mathematical beauty of gravitational dynamics.

USER INPUT #5:
The 3-body problem is too complex and chaotic. Can you instead create a simple elliptical animation with a ball moving in an ellipse pattern?

KIRO OUTPUT #5:
Created a clean elliptical ball animation as requested.

Created ellipse-animation.js with:
- Simple parametric ellipse equations (x = a*cos(t), y = b*sin(t))
- Smooth circular ball moving along elliptical path
- Clean animation loop with requestAnimationFrame
- Adjustable ellipse dimensions and speed
- Centered on canvas with proper scaling

Much simpler and more predictable than the chaotic 3-body system.

USER INPUT #6:
Can you make the ball bigger and add a trail effect behind it?

KIRO OUTPUT #6:
Enhanced the elliptical animation with larger ball and trail effect.

Changes Made:
- Increased ball radius from 5 to 15 pixels
- Added trail effect by using semi-transparent background clearing
- Trail fades gradually creating a comet-like effect
- Maintained smooth elliptical motion
- Adjustable trail length through alpha transparency

---

USER INPUT #7:
Can you center the ellipse animation better on the page and make sure it fits well within the layout?

KIRO OUTPUT #7:
Improved the ellipse animation centering and layout integration.

Changes Made:
- Centered canvas properly within its container
- Added responsive canvas sizing
- Improved CSS positioning and margins
- Ensured animation stays centered regardless of screen size
- Better integration with overall page layout

---

USER INPUT #8:
Can you update the README file to include information about all the features we've added?

KIRO OUTPUT #8:
Updated README.md with comprehensive documentation of all features.

Added Documentation For:
- Homepage layout and navigation
- Tabbed content system with animations
- Embedded content (links, images, videos)
- Interactive tab selection states
- Elliptical ball animation with trail effects
- Deployment instructions for GitHub Pages
- Customization guidelines
- File structure overview

The README now serves as a complete guide for understanding and modifying the portfolio website.

CONVERSATION SUMMARY:
This session involved building a complete portfolio website from scratch with:
- Multi-page navigation system
- Interactive tabbed content with hover and selection animations
- Embedded multimedia content
- Custom elliptical ball animation with trail effects
- Comprehensive documentation

The website is fully functional and ready for GitHub Pages deployment, with all requested features implemented and properly documented.
